## Pocket Kitchen

Pocket Kitchen is a web application that makes the process of cooking easier, through the use of looping videos and short written instructions. For this project, I filmed and edited the video content, designed the app's UX/UI, and built the app with HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.

You can access the app from any smartphone at [www.pocket.kitchen/app.](http://www.pocket.kitchen/app)
