## About Me

Hi! I'm a designer & developer based out of Kingston, New York. I grew up just across the river in Red Hook, NY (the Dutchess County town, not the Brooklyn neighborhood), and I have a BFA in Graphic Design from SUNY New Paltz. If I'm not making things, I'm probably outside, hiking, roller skating or riding my bike.

## Contact

Interested in working with me?  
Just wanna say hi?  
Feel free to drop me a line at  
[hello@kristofflalicki.com](mailto:hello@kristofflalicki.com)

## Colophon

I designed and developed this site myself,  
with a bit of HTML,  
a bit of [jQuery,](https://jquery.com/)  
and [Velocity.js.](https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity)

Typeset in [Work Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) by Wei Huang, served through Google Fonts,  
and [Squircular](/squircular/) by me.
